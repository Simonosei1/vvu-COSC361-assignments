# QUEUE

# **QUEUE** 
Queue is a linear data structure where the first element is inserted from one end called REAR and deleted from the other end called as FRONT.
Front points to the beginning of the queue and Rear points to the end of the queue.
Queue follows the FIFO (First - In - First Out) structure.
According to its FIFO structure, element inserted first will also be removed first.
In a queue, one end is always used to insert data (enqueue) and the other is used to delete data (dequeue), because queue is open at both its ends.
The enqueue() and dequeue() are two important functions used in a queue.
